# Project Report: Predicting Obesity Levels

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Obesity is a significant health issue globally, leading to various comorbidities and reduced quality of life.

### 1.2 Objective
The objective of this project is to predict obesity levels based on various demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors.

## 2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### 2.1 Dataset Description
- The dataset comprises demographic information such as age, gender, location, and physical attributes like height and weight.
- Lifestyle factors include dietary habits, physical activity, and transportation mode.

### 2.2 Data Preprocessing
- Missing values were handled through deletion of rows with missing data.
- Categorical variables were encoded using LabelEncoder.
- New features were engineered, including interactions between existing features and transformations of certain variables.

## 3. Feature Engineering

### 3.1 Feature Creation
- New features were created based on interactions and transformations of existing features.
- Features such as age-gender interaction, caloric intake, and health habits score were calculated.

### 3.2 Feature Importance Analysis
- Feature importance was assessed using XGBoost Classifier.
- Top features were identified based on importance scores.

## 4. Model Training and Evaluation

### 4.1 Model Selection
- Several classification algorithms were considered, including Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks.

### 4.2 Model Training
- The dataset was split into training and validation sets.
- Models were trained on the training set using various algorithms.

### 4.3 Model Evaluation
- Models were evaluated based on accuracy and F1-score on the validation set.
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were performed to optimize model performance.

## 5. Results and Discussion

### 5.1 Model Performance
- The performance of each model was compared based on evaluation metrics.
- Insights into the most influential features on obesity prediction were discussed.
- Classification Model Evaluation Report
F1 Scores
Gradient Boosting: 0.8934
AdaBoost: 0.4721
KNN: 0.7756
Naive Bayes: 0.6793
Random Forest: 0.8855
XGBoost: 0.8931
SVM: 0.5545
These F1 scores were obtained after evaluating the performance of various classification models on the dataset. The models were trained and tested using appropriate methodologies and metrics.

Model Comparison
Upon reviewing the F1 scores, it's evident that Gradient Boosting and XGBoost perform the best among the models considered, with F1 scores of 0.8934 and 0.8931, respectively. Random Forest also demonstrates strong performance with an F1 score of 0.8855. However, AdaBoost lags significantly behind with an F1 score of 0.4721, indicating its limitations on this dataset.

### 5.2 Challenges and Limitations
- Challenges encountered during data preprocessing and model training were discussed.
- Limitations of the study, such as dataset size and feature availability, were addressed.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Work

### 6.1 Conclusion
- The study successfully predicted obesity levels using demographic and lifestyle factors.
- Model performance was satisfactory, with potential for practical application in healthcare and public health interventions.

### 6.2 Future Work
